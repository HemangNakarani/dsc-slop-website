                  Participants can apply for the program either as a student or as a mentor. Mentors are selected
                  through a selection process. The selected mentors propose projects, the best of which are chosen
                  to be included in the program. Students work on these projects in their winter vacations. The mentors
                  review the pull requests and the overall work on their project by various contributors throughout the
                  coding period of the program. At the end of the coding period, the students are compared on the
                  basis of most contributions.
